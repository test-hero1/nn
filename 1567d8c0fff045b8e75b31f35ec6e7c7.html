						<h4>The good way to invest your money (everyone can do it)</h4>
						<p><strong></strong> Every person and every family can become a wealthy investor.Just a few steps on the way to big money are all it will take.In this article, we will talk about how to get started invest your money, how not to be afraid of failure, how to protect your savings from inflation and risks. success, and how to optimize your money expenses.Innovation continues to innovate.And this year it opened its doors wide to all people. To them, on average, there is a flat fee for completing the initial setup. And this is true for everyone.This is true regardless of how much money you earn, how much time you've worked, and how well you do things.The good news is that you don't need to be a "financial guru" to make money on investments. You can start investing a small amount of money right away.And as a result, you will gradually form a large financial capital, the income from which will fully support you and your entire family.Ready to try your hand at investing?Here's what you'll need to do:1) you'll need to fill up your "financial pillow"Once every 10-20 years, the stock market is expected to grow significantly. And many people will be happy to buy shares of good companies at low quotes (so they can trade them on a regular basis).But there is no need to "pillow" in the belief that this is the best time to invest.Experience has shown that such a "pillow" will only make you a loser investor (not an investor).Not for nothing, it is said that" The gambler never wins". So keep a small amount of money on Deposit in a Bank, just in case something unexpected happens.2) Set yourself a goal.Think about how you want to spend the money you earn.What will you do with it?What will you do differently than before?Take a piece of paper and write down everything you will do differently (for example, take a step up your career, improve your skills, or master a new profession). in the future).3) Stop being afraid.It's time to let your money "make" decisions for you.You can be afraid of losing your job, or your income will decrease, or your boss may suddenly become a villain and fire you.But no matter how you feel at the moment, you need to take a step towards your financial goals.Today, many people are looking for an excellent reason to ask for a salary increase, or to change your profession. But this is the same fear that has kept them at the poverty line for so long — because they knew in the back of their minds that they would never become rich.Get used to "paying yourself first" and only then paying others.4) Make your money "work".To do this,</p>
